👋 Welcome to the E-Commerce Microservices Project!

Thank you for visiting this repository!

This project showcases an e-commerce platform built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, following a modern microservices architecture. It is designed to demonstrate how scalable and maintainable systems can be built using:

- Independent services for product, order, and inventory

 - REST-based communication

- API Gateway for routing

- Eureka Service Discovery

- JPA & relational databases for persistence

The main purpose of this project is to show how real-world business modules can be split into isolated, scalable services that can evolve independently with minimal impact on other components.

Feel free to explore the code, run the services, and experiment with the architecture.
Contributions, suggestions, and feature ideas are always welcome! 🚀
